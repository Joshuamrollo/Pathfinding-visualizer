This app was created using ReactJS. The app animates popular pathfinding algorithms such as A\*, breadth first search, depth first search, and dijkstras algorithm. I also used a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate a maze of walls on the grid. Users are able to draw walls on the grid by clicking and dragging the mouse. When the visualize button is pressed the selected algorithm will run and be animated on the screen.
